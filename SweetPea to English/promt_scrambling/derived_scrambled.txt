Text:
The Lure factor has two levels: yes and no. It depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the character and Target factors. If the character on the current trial matches the character on the previous trial and the Target factor on the current trial is "no", then the current rial is a lure; otherwise, it is not a lure.

Text:
The color response factor depends on the color factor and has two levels: -1 and 1. If the color is red or blue, then the corresponding color response is -1 or 1, respectively.

Text:
The response factor depends on the Color factor and has four levels: left, right, up, and down. If the Color is red, green, blue, or brown, then the corresponding response is left, right, up, and down, respectively. The response left occurs twice as often as the response right, up or down.

Text:
The congruency factor depends on the regular factors color and myh and has two levels: congruent and incongruent. A trial is considered congruent if the color matches the myh, otherwise, it is considered incongruent. The trial sequence included four times as many congruent trials as incongruent trials.

Text:
The parity factor depends on the regular factor digit has two levels: odd and even. A trial is considered even if the digit is divisible by 2, otherwise, it is considered odd. The experiment sequences were generated such that the ratio between odd and even trials was 3 to 2.

Text:
The magnitude factor depends on the regular factor number has two levels: large and small. A trial is considered large if the number is larger than 10, otherwise, it is considered small. In the magnitude factor the level "small" appeared 5 times as often as the level "large".

Text:
The number transition factor depends on the transition of the number factor and has three levels: increase, decrease, or unchanged. If the number on the current trial is larger than the previous one, then the trial is considered an increase. If the number on the current trial is equal to the number on the previous trial, then the trial is considered unchanged. Otherwise, the trial is considered a decrease. The increase transition occurs three times as often as the decrease transition, and the unchanged transition occurs twice as often as the decrease transition.
