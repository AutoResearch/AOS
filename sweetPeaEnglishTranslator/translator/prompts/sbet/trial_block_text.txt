flanker = FlankerStimulus(duration=1000, direction=TimelineVariable('direction of arrow'), correct=correct,distractor=TimelineVariable('distractor direction'), choices=['a', 'l'])
fixation = Fixation(1000)
Each trial started with a fixation cross, presented for 1000 at the centre of the screen, followed by a Eriksen flanker task.
Code:
trial_block = TrialBlock([fixation, flanker], trial_sequence)
experiment = Experiment([trial_block])

response_stimulus_interval = BlankStimulus(duration=TimelineVariable("iti"))
feedback = FeedbackStimulus(duration=400, kind='screen', on_correct=False)
stimuli_trial = TextStimulus(text=TimelineVariable('stimuli'), correct=correct, choices=['1', '3'])
before_stimulus = TextStimulus(duration=800, text=text)
Before each stimulus, either the words, "What number?" or the words "How many?" appeared for 800ms, depending on which task was being performed on that trial. A variable reponse-stimulus interval (RSI) of 300-600 ms was used for all blocks. When errors were made, a 400ms, red screen appeared
trial_block = TrialBlock([before_stimulus, stimulus_trial, feedback, response_stimulus_interval])
experiment = Experiment([trial_block])
