flanker = FlankerStimulus(duration=1000, direction=TimelineVariable('direction of arrow'), correct=correct,distractor=TimelineVariable('distractor direction'), choices=['a', 'l'])
fixation = Fixation(1000)
Each trial started with a fixation cross, presented for 1000 at the centre of the screen, followed by a Eriksen flanker task.
Code:
trial_block = TrialBlock([fixation, flanker], trial_sequence)
experiment = Experiment([trial_block])
