### DERIVED FACTORS
there are two derived factors: congruency and congruency transition.
## congruency
the congruency factor depends on the color factor and the word factor and has two levels: "congruent" and "incongruent". a task is considered "congruent" if word and color are the same. otherwise it is considered "incongruent".
## congruency transition
the congruency transition factor depends on the transition of the congruency factor and has two levels: "switch" and "repetition". a task is considered a "repetition" if the congruency of the previous trial is the same as in the current trial. otherwise it is considered a "switch".

there is one regular factor called letter with the levels "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F". there are two derived factors: target and lure. the target factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter three trials back, then the trial is a target. conversely, if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back, then the trial is not a target. the ratio between target and not a target level was 13 to 11. the lure factor also depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back or the letter two trials back, then the trial is a lure. otherwise, the current trial is not a lure. the is a lure level occured seven times as often as the not a lure level. we counterbalanced the target and lure factors.

there is one regular factor called letter with the levels "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F". there are four derived factors: target, one-back lure, two-back lure and n-back lure. the target factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter three trials back, then the trial is a target. conversely, if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back, then the trial is not a target. the one-back lure factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back, then the trial is a one-back lure. otherwise, the current trial is not a one-back lure. the two-back lure factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back, then the trial is a two-back lure. otherwise, the current trial is not a two-back lure. the n-back lure factor also depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the current trial is either a one-back lure or a two-back lure, then the trial is considered an n-back lure. otherwise, the current trial is not an n-back lure. we counterbalanced the target and the n-back lure factors and generated a minimum of 103 trials.

we have the regular factors: soa and size. the soa is either 200ms or 700ms. the size is either big or small. as a derived factor we had lubadoo that was large if soa was 200ms and size was small. it was small if soa was 200ms and size was large. otherwize it was undefined. as sescond derived factor was libadii. this was large if lubadoo was small and 200ms otherwise. the large level occured ten times as often as the 200ms level. the size and the soa were counterbalanced. however there was no small trial in the lubadoo factor.

The letter factor consists of eight levels: "b", "d", "f", "h", "s", "u", "w", and "y". The task factor consists of three levels: "number task", "letter task", and "free choice task". There is a derived factor called task transition. The task transition factor depends on the transition of the task factor and has five levels: "forced switch", "forced repeat", "free transition", "free repeat", and "forced first". If the task on the current trial is "number task" and the task on the previous trial is "letter task" then the trial is considered a "forced switch". If the task on the current trial is "number task" the trial is considered a "forced repeat". If the task on the current trial is "free choice task" and the task on the previous trial is not "free choice task", the trial is considered a "free transition".
