There are two regular factors: object identity and motion. The object identity factor consists of two levels: "H" and "S". The motion factor also consists of the two levels: "left" and "right". There are three derived factors: correct response, response congruency, and congruency transition. The response factor depends on the object identity factor and has two levels: "left" and "right". If the object identity is "H", then the corresponding response is "left". If the object identity is "S", then the corresponding response is "right". The response congruency factor depends on the motion and response factors and has two levels: "compatible" and "incompatible". A trial is considered "compatible" if the motion matches the response, otherwise, it is considered "incompatible". The congruency transition factor depends on the transition of the congruency factor and has two levels: "repeat" and "switch". If the congruency on the current trial is the same as on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "repeat", otherwise, it is considered a "switch". The "repeat" transition occurs twice as often as the "switch" transition. We counterbalanced the object identity factor with the motion factor and the congruency transition factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to three constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 5 of the same responses in a row. Second, we allowed for no more than 5 of the same congruency transitions in a row. Third, all experiment sequences contained at least 100 trials. All experiment sequences were sampled uniformly from the space of all counterbalanced sequences.
