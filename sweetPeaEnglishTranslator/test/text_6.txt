There is one regular factor called letter with the levels "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F". There are four derived factors: target, one-back lure, two-back lure, and n-back lure. The target factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the letter factor. If the letter on the current trial matches the letter three trials back, then the trial is a target. Conversely, if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back, then the trial is not a target. The one-back lure factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. If the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back, then the trial is a one-back lure. Otherwise, the current trial is not a one-back lure. The two-back lure factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. If the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back, then the trial is a two-back lure. Otherwise, the current trial is not a two-back lure. The n-back lure factor also depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. If the current trial is either a one-back lure or a two-back lure, then the trial is considered an n-back lure. Otherwise, the current trial is not an n-back lure. We counterbalanced the target and the n-back lure factors and generated a minimum of 103 trials.
