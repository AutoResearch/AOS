In the experiment there are the regular factors color and word. The color is either red or green as is the word. As a derived factor we had congruency that was congruent if color and word were the same. It was incongruent otherwise. Another derived factor was congruency transition. This was repeat if congruency in the current trial was the same as in the previous. Otherwise it was switch. The color, word and congruency transition were counterbalanced.
