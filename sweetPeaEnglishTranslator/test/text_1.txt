### REGULAR FACTORS
There are three regular factors: color, word and iti. The color can be "red", "green" or "pink". The word can be "red", "neutral" or "blue". The iti is either 300 or 500.
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: congruency and congruency transition.
## congruency factor
The congruency factor depends on the color factor and the word factor and has two levels: "congruent" and "incongruent". A task is considered "congruent" if word and color are the same. Otherwise it is considered "incongruent".
## congruency transittion factor
The congruency transition factor depends on the transition of the congruency factor and has two levels: "switch" and "repetition". A task is considered a "repetition" if the congruency of the previous trial is the same as in the current trial. Otherwise it is considered a "switch".
### EXPERIMENT
We counterbalanced the color, word and iti facter. However, the trial sequence was constructed in a way that no congruent trials were included.
