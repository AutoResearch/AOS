In the experiment there are the regular factors iti and length. The iti is either long or short as is the length. As a derived factor we had alignment that was aligned if length and iti were the same. It was unalgined otherwise. Another derived factor was alignment transition. This was aligned if length in the current trial was the same as iti in the previous. Otherwise it was unaligned. The iti, alignment and alignment transition were counterbalanced. There was no unaligned trials in the alignemnt transition factor.
