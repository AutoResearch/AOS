Then, an emotional (50% of all trials) or a neutral (50% of all trials) picture was presented for 100ms, followed by a blank screen presented for 50ms. . In the colour-discrimination task, participants were to indicate by keypress whether a square, presented at the centre of the screen for 1000 ms was blue (RGB = 0; 0; 254) or green (RGB = 0; 128; 0). The square subtended 4.89° of visual angle in width and height. Stimulus-to-key-mapping for the colour-discrimination task (i.e. n-key or v-key) was counterbalanced across participants.
