Each trial started with a fixation cross ('x') presented on the screen for 500ms, followed by a color word (i.e.,) or neutral letters that consisted of a series of three or five Xs matched to the number of letters in the two color words presented in either green or red print-color where they had to response with either 'C' or 'N'. An error tone was presented if participants pressed the wrong key or did not respond within 1500ms. There was a 1500ms inter-trial-interval before the next fixation cross occurred.
