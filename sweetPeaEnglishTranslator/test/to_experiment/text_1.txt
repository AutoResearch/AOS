Each trial started with a fixation cross, subtending 0.48° of visual angle1 in width and height presented for 1000 ms at the centre of the screen, followed by a congruent (50% of all trials) or incongruent arrow version (50% of all trials) of the Eriksen flanker task. One arrow subtended 0.67° (width) × 0.38° (height) of visual angle. In the flanker task, participants were to indicate the direction of the target arrow by pressing one of two previously assigned keys (i.e. a-key for the target arrow pointing to the left and l-key for the target arrow pointing to the right). The arrows remained on the screen for 1000 ms or until a response was registered. Then, an emotional (50% of all trials) or a neutral (50% of all trials) picture was presented for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen presented for 50 ms. Picture stimuli were subtended 11.99° (width) × 9.05° (height) of visual angle. In the colour-discrimination task, participants were to indicate by keypress whether a square, presented at the centre of the screen for 1000 ms was blue (RGB = 0; 0; 254) or green (RGB = 0; 128; 0). The square subtended 4.89° of visual angle in width and height. Stimulus-to-key-mapping for the colour-discrimination task (i.e. n-key or v-key) was counterbalanced across participants.
