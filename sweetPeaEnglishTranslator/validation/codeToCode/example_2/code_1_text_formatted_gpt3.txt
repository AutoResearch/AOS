### REGULAR FACTORS
there is one regular factor: letter. the letter factor consists of the eight letters: "b", "f", "m", "q", "k", "x", "r", and "h".
### DERIVED FACTORS
there are three derived factors: target, one_back, and condi.
## target factor
the target factor has two levels: "1" and "2". it depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back, then the trial is "1". otherwise, the trial is "2". the level "2" occured 5 times as often as the level "1".
## one_back factor
the one_back factor has two levels: "1" and "2". it depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter on the previous trial, then the trial is a "2". otherwise, the trial is a "1". the "1" level occured 5 times as often as the "2" level.
## condi factor
the condi factor has four levels: "1/1/0", "1/2/0", "2/1/0", and "2/2/0". it depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial does not match the letter one trial back, then the trial is "1/1/0". if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back, then the trial is "1/2/0". if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial does not match the letter one trial back, then the trial is "2/1/0". if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back, then the trial is "2/2/0". the "1/1/0" level occured three times as often as the "1/2/0" level. the "2/1/0" level occured 17 times as often as the "1/1/0" level. the "2/2/0" level occured three times as often as the "1/2/0" level.
### EXPERIMENT
we crossed the letter factor with the target factor. we also counterbalanced the one_back factor and the condi factor individually. all experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
