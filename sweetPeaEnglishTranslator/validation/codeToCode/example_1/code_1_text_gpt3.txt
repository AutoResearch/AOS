There are two regular factors: color and word. The color factor consists of four levels: "red", "green", "blue", and "yellow". The word factor also consists of the four levels: "red", "green", "blue", and "yellow". There is another derived factor referred to as congruency. The congruency factor depends on the regular factors word and color and has two levels: "congruent" and "incongruent". A trial is considered "congruent" if the word matches the color, otherwise, it is considered "incongruent". We counterbalanced the word factor with the congruency factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that all experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
