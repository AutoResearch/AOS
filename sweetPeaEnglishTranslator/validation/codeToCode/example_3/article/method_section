For the two-back task (Kirchner, 1958); single letters were con-
secutively presented on the screen. Participants were instructed to
press the green-labeled C-key when the currently presented letter
matched the one presented two trials earlier (target trials). For all
other letters (nontarget trials), they were supposed to press the red-
labeled B-key. Twenty different letters (B C D F G H J K L M N
P Q R S T V W Y Z) were selected as stimuli and used repeatedly
without replacement. Stimuli were presented in random order for
500 ms each in the center of the screen followed by a 3-s response
window. The task was divided into eight subblocks consisting of
13 nontarget and eight target trials each. The first three trials of
each subblock were always nontarget trials. Subsequent trials were
randomly determined to be target or nontarget trials. Each sub-
block of the two-back task ended with a thought probe, so that
there were eight thought probes in total. The false-alarm rate on
nontarget trials was subtracted from the correct-response rate on
target trials to achieve a target/nontarget discrimination perform-
ance measure (PR).
