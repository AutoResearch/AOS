### REGULAR FACTORS
there are two regular factors: color and word. the color factor consists of four levels: "red", "green", "blue", and "yellow". the word factor also consists of the four levels: "red", "green", "blue", and "yellow".
### DERIVED FACTORS
there is another derived factor referred to as congruency.
## congruency
the congruency factor depends on the regular factors word and color and has two levels: "congruent" and "incongruent". a trial is considered "congruent" if the word matches the color, otherwise, it is considered "incongruent".
### EXPERIMENT
we counterbalanced the word factor with the congruency factor. all experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
