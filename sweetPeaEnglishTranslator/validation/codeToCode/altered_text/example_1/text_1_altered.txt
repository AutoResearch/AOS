There are two independent variables: color and word. The color variable consists of four levels: "red", "green", "blue", and "yellow". The word variable also consists of the four levels: "red", "green", "blue", and "yellow". There is another derived variable referred to as congruency. The congruency variable depends on the independent variables word and color and has two levels: "congruent" and "incongruent". A trial is considered "congruent" if the word matches the color, otherwise, it is considered "incongruent". We crossed the word variable with the congruency variable. All experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
