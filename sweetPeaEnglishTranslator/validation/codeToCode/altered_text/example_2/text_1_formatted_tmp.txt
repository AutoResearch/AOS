### REGULAR FACTORS
there is one regular factor: letter. the letter factor consists of the eight letters: "b", "f", "m", "q", "k", "x", "r", and "h".
### DERIVED FACTORS
there are three derived factors: target, one back, and condi.
## target
the target factor has two levels: 1 and 2. it depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back, then the trial is 1. otherwise, the trial is 2. the ratio between the levels 1 and 2 was 1 to 5.
## one back
the one back factor has two levels: 1 and 2. it depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter on the previous trial, then the trial has the level 2. otherwise, the trial has the level 1. the ratio between the levels 1 and 2 was 5 to 1.
## condi
the condi factor has four levels: "1/1/0", "1/2/0", "2/1/0", and "2/2/0". it depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the letter factor. if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial does not match the letter one trial back, then the trial is "1/1/0". if the letter on the current trial matches the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back, then the trial is "1/2/0". if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial does not match the letter one trial back, then the trial is "2/1/0". if the letter on the current trial does not match the letter two trials back and the letter on the current trial matches the letter one trial back, then the trial is "2/2/0". the ratio between the levels "1/1/0" and "2/1/0" was 3 to 17. the ratio between the levels "1/2/0" and "2/2/0" was 1 to 3.
### EXPERIMENT
we crossed the letter factor and the target factor. we also counterbalanced the one back factor and the condi factor individually. all experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
